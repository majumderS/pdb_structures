; TIMESTEP IN MARTINI 
; Most simulations are numerically stable with dt=40 fs, 
; however better energy conservation is achieved using a 
; 20-30 fs timestep. 
; Time steps smaller than 20 fs are not required unless specifically stated in the itp file.

; NEIGHBOURLIST and MARTINI 
; To achieve faster simulations in combination with the Verlet-neighborlist
; scheme, Martini can be simulated with a straight cutoff. In order to 
; do so, the cutoff distance is reduced 1.1 nm. 
; Neighborlist length should be optimized depending on your hardware setup:
; updating ever 20 steps should be fine for classic systems, while updating
; every 30-40 steps might be better for GPU based systems.
; The Verlet neighborlist scheme will automatically choose a proper neighborlist
; length, based on a energy drift tolerance.
;
; Coulomb interactions can alternatively be treated using a reaction-field,
; giving slightly better properties.
; Please realize that electrostVatic interactions in the Martini model are 
; not considered to be very accurate to begin with, especially as the 
; screening in the system is set to be uniform across the system with 
; a screening constant of 15. When using PME, please make sure your 
; system properties are still reasonable.
;
; With the polarizable water model, the relative electrostatic screening 
; (epsilon_r) should have a value of 2.5, representative of a low-dielectric
; apolar solvent. The polarizable water itself will perform the explicit screening
; in aqueous environment. In this case, the use of PME is more realistic.

; MARTINI and TEMPERATURE/PRESSURE
; normal temperature and pressure coupling schemes can be used. 
; It is recommended to couple individual groups in your system separately.
; Good temperature control can be achieved with the velocity rescale (V-rescale)
; thermostat using a coupling constant of the order of 1 ps. Even better 
; temperature control can be achieved by reducing the temperature coupling 
; constant to 0.1 ps, although with such tight coupling (approaching 
; the time step) one can no longer speak of a weak-coupling scheme.
; We therefore recommend a coupling time constant of at least 0.5 ps.
; The Berendsen thermostat is less suited since it does not give
; a well described thermodynamic ensemble.
; 
; Pressure can be controlled with the Parrinello-Rahman barostat, 
; with a coupling constant in the range 4-8 ps and typical compressibility 
; in the order of 10e-4 - 10e-5 bar-1. Note that, for equilibration purposes, 
; the Berendsen barostat probably gives better results, as the Parrinello-
; Rahman is prone to oscillating behaviour. For bilayer systems the pressure 
; coupling should be done semiisotropic.
